# How do players access the blackmarket?

One of two ways!

They can either do a quick hack. Upon completion of said hack, they'll be given a code that they can give over to be teleported in or they can answer one of many
configurable questions/riddles from the [Config.EntranceTypes.Riddles]

# How do players exit the market?

Players can simply speak to a ped inside the market to leave. Upon leaving the market, the player will be respawned in one of the locations from [ExitInfo.ExitLocations] table (We prefer to keep these locations within a fair walking distance of local traffic or a garage)

# FAQ

# How do I move the locations of stuff?

Easy! Every location (Minus particle effects and the like) are all in the config. So, moving everything is kept just about all in one place!

# Why can't my players take a car inside the market?

SIMPLE! Not all server owners will have this location in a vehicle friendly location and we didn't want to make a config value and a bunch of code for some to do so and others not

# Why aren't you using ["marked_bills"] for your currency of dirty money?
